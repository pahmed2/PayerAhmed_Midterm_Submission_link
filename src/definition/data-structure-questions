Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
    - Data structure is a specialized format for organizing and storing data.
      ny data structure is designed to organize data to suit a specific purpose so that it can be accessed and worked
      with in appropriate ways.
What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
    - Traversing
      Searching
      Inserting
      Deleting
      Sorting
      Merging

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
    - mpiler Design,
      Operating System,
      Database Management System,
      Statistical analysis package,
      Numerical Analysis,
      Graphics,
      Artificial Intelligence,
      Simulation.

what is an Array?
    - Array is a collection of data/values where each value has an index or location associated with it.

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
    - An array is basic functionality provided by Java. ArrayList is part of collection framework in Java.
      Array is a fixed size data structure while ArrayList is not. Even if we specify some initial capacity,
      we can add more elements.

what is LinkedList?
    - A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object

How is an Array different from Linked List?
    - In array, each element is independent, no connection with previous element or with its location. In Linked list,
      location or address of elements is stored in the link part of previous element/node.

what is queue?
    - Queue is an ordered list of objects with its use limited to inserting elements at the end of list and deleting elements
      from the start of list, it follows FIFO principle.

what is stack?
    - stack is a collection that is based on the last in first out (LIFO) principle.

what is FIFO and LIFO?
    - First In First Out, Last In First Out.

what is the order of complexity?
    - If we think input size is N, we can say that the algorithm will order of complexity at O(1), O(N), O(N^2), O(N^3), O(N*log(N)) etc

what is the best case to search an element from an array?
   - In the case of sorted array In best case, if the element to be searched is at first position then linear search requires only one comparison.

what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
    - The worst-case complexity of the algorithm is the function defined by the maximum number of steps taken on any instance
      of size n.

what is tree in data structure?
    - Tree is a non-linear data structure where data objects are organized in terms of hierarchical relationship

what is graph in data structure?
    - Graph is an object consisting of a vertex set and an edge set. it is no-linear.

what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
    - HashMap allows null values as key and value whereas Hashtable doesn't allow nulls). HashMap does not guarantee that the order of the map will
      remain constant over time. HashMap is non synchronized whereas Hashtable is synchronized.

What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
    - RDBMS – Array
      Network data model – Graph
      Hierarchical data model – Trees

How HashMap works in java?
    - HashMap provides put(key, value) for storing and get(key) method for retrieving Values from HashMap.

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
    - This exception is thrown when we try to access an array item that doesn't exist.

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
    - We can directly copy one array to another by using Arrays.copyOf() method. System.arraycopy(),  another method
      that directly copies one array to another by  Object.clone()

What is difference between an array and a linked list?
    - In array, each element is independent, no connection with previous element or with its location. In Linked list,
      location or address of elements is stored in the link part of previous element/node.

What is DFS and BFS?
    - Depth First Search, Breadth First Search.

What is Recursion?
    - Recursion is a way a programmer can use to invoke a function call on itself.

What are linear and non linear data Structures?
    - linear data structures are Arrays, Stack, Queue and Linked List.
      The data structure where data items are not organized sequentially is called non linear data structure.
      non linear data structures are Trees and Graphs.

What is Big-(O)-notation?
    - Big-(O)-notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm.

Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
