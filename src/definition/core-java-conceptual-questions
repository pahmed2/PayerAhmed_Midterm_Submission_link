Please answer the below core-java Questions:


What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
    -JDK contains everything that is in JRE, plus tools such as the compilers and debuggers necessary for developing
     applets and applications. JRE provides the libraries, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM),
     and other components to run applets and applications written in the Java programming language
What is IDE?
    -IDE is stand for Integrated Development Environments is a software application
     that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development.
     An IDE normally consists of a source code editor, build automation tools and a debugge
What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
    - NetBeans
    - IntelliJ
    - Eclipse
    - BlueJ
    - jEdit
    - jGRASP
    - jSource
Explain the entire java life cycle.
    - file is saved as a .java file on the disk. We then compile this text file using the Java compiler, which result in
      a .class file being created on the disk. The .class file contains the bytecodes. The file is then loaded into
      memory by the class loader. The bytecode verifier confirms that the bytecodes are valid and not. Finally,
      the JVM reads the bytecodes in memory and translates them into machine code.

what is class?
    - class is a templet that describes the data and behavior associated with instances of that class
What is object?
    - object is a instance of the class
What is the entry point of an application?
    - The main method is the entry point of an application
Why main is static?
    - main is called by the JVM before any objects are made. Since it is static it can be directly invoked via the class.
     Similarly, we use static sometime for user defined methods so that we need not to make objects. void indicates that
     the main() method being declared does not return a value.

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
    - Interface is declaration of methods but not implementation but Abstract is some declaration and some implementation.

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
    - we can't instantiate or make an object in an abstract class or an interface we can only instantiate one of their
      derived classes.

what is Access Specifier?
    - Access Specifier is the set the accessibility of classes, methods, and other members.
    - Private, Public, Protected

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
    - Object Oriented Programming. Feature of OOP like Inheritance, Encapsulation, Abstraction, Polymorphism.

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
    - Application Programming Interface. so far we used java API

Does java support multiple inheritance?
    - No
What is method overloading and when it happens?
    - Method Overloading is a feature that allows a class to have more than one method having the same name, if their
      argument lists are different. It is similar to constructor overloading in Java, that allows a class to have more than
      one constructor having different argument lists.

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
    -java provides two different options to handle an exception. You can either use the try-catch-finally approach to
     handle all kinds of exceptions. Or you can use the try-with-resource approach which allows an easier cleanup
     process for resources.

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
    - In Java, a static member is a member of a class that isn’t associated with an instance of a class.
      One of the basic rules of working with static methods is that you can’t access a nonstatic method or field from a
      static method because the static method doesn’t have an instance of the class to use to reference instance methods or fields.

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
    - In terms of Variable that we can't we can't modify it's variable value.
      In terms of method that we can't override it's super class method in sub-class

What is final, finally and finalize?
    - Final: Final class can't be inherited, final method can't be overriden and final variable value can't be changed.
      Finally: is used to place implement code, it will be executed whether exception is handled or not
      Finalize: is used to perform clean up processing just before object is garbage collection.

What is a constructor ?
    -   to initialize of the object, the constructor should be same as class name.

What is "this" keyword in java ?
    - can be used to invoke or initiate current class constructor.

What is "super" keyword in java?
    - It is used inside a sub-class method definition to call a method defined in the super class. Private methods of
      the super-class cannot be called. Only public and protected methods can be called by the super keyword.

What is JVM stand for ?
    - Java Virtual Machine

What version of java are you using?
    - Java version 9.0.1

What is JAR stand for ?
    - Java ARchive

What is compile time and run time?
    - The source code must be compiled into machine code in order to become and executable program. This compilation process
      is referred to as compile time.(think of a compiler as a translator) A compiled program can be opened and run by a user.
      When an application is running, it is called runtime.

What is heap?
    - The heap is the runtime data area from which memory for all class instances and arrays is allocated.

How java manage it's memory?
    - Java objects reside in an area called the heap. ... When the heap becomes full, garbage is collected. During the garbage
      collection objects that are no longer used are cleared, thus making space for new objects. Note that the JVM uses more
      memory than just the heap.

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
    - String is immutable, if you try to alter their values, another object gets created, whereas StringBuffer and StringBuilder
      are mutable so they can change their values.

What is Singleton class?
    - Singleton pattern helps us to keep only one instance of a class at any time. The purpose of singleton is to control object
      creation by keeping private constructor.

What is Serialization and Deserialization?
    - Serialization is the process of converting an object into a stream of bytes in order to store the object,
      the reverse process is called deserialization.

Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
    - Integer

Why is String Immutable in Java?
    - The string is Immutable in Java because String objects are cached in String pool.

What is constructor chaining in Java?
    - Constructor chaining is the process of calling one constructor from another constructor with respect to current object.

The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
    - serial collector is a default copying collector which uses only one Garbage Collection thread for the Garbage Collection
      operation, while a parallel collector uses multiple Garbage Collection threads for the Garbage Collection operation

What is JIT stands for?
    - Just-In-Time

Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
    - During the garbage collection objects that are no longer used are cleared, thus making space for new objects. Note that
      the JVM uses more memory than just the heap. For example Java methods, thread stacks and native handles are allocated in
      memory separate from the heap, as well as JVM internal data structures.

Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
    - This decision is taken by the JVM based on the eden space availability in heap.

What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
    - Stack is used for static memory allocation and Heap for dynamic memory allocation, both stored in the computer's RAM.
      The basic difference between stack and heap is the life cycle of the values. Stack values only exist within the scope
      of the function they are created in. Once it returns, they are discarded. Heap values however exist on the heap. They
      are created at some point in time, and destructed at another either by Garbage Collector or manually.
